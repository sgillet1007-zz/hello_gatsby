            Mike Dudley- Bass Guitar As the latest addition to the band in 2012, Mike is a jack of trades and a master of all of them. Although he plays bass for the group, in the absence of Joel or Trent he fills in as a drummer or a mandolin player. Other then laying down a groove you might see him stagediving, smashing guitars, and biting the heads of small animals on stage.

            Sam Gillet - Drums, Cymbals, & Waffle Pan Hailing from the mean streets of east Belgium, Sam learned early on how to scrap for his next waffle and knows first hand  just how vital caramelized pearl sugar is to the taste of a true Li√®ge-style gaufre.  In the rare moments when he isn't contemplating waffle batter, Sam is practicing for his next drum solo with the tourists.  His secret weapon of choice during live shows is a stainless steel food service pan he uses as a cowbell.
